# BBB_CAPE Firmware

This is the firmware for the power and serial expansion board for the BBB.  This is part of the VIOBoard project [See Here](https://www.simkus.com/projects/vics-io-board/).

## Hardware

The board is based around a PIC24FV32KA302 chip.  The built-in ADC senses the voltage drop across the low-side sense resistor purely for informational purposes.  Several completely unnecessary LEDs are provided for visual excitement.  Hardware details are provided under the hardware-portion of project.
